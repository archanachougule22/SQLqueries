Upsell Transactions

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.

Assumptions-
  •	“upsell” is purchasing an additional product after purchasing a first product
  •	the additional product(s) must be purchased on a later date (ie. not the same day as the first product)
  •	the additional “upsell” product(s) can be the same type of product (product_id) as the first product
  
SQL Query-
select
count(distinct t1.user_id) as num_of_upsold_customers
from
transactions t1
inner join transactions t2
on t1.user_id = t2.user_id
and date(t1.created_at) < date(t2.created_at)
